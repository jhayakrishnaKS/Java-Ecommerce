# Files created:
1. "User credential" file for storing user data.

2. "Product data" file for storing Products.
   
3. "Cart data" file for storing user cart details.


# Steps involved in creating this project:

1. Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for developing the console application.
2. Added the required Models, Views and Controller along with Interface implementation to achieve abstraction.
3. Added user-defined exceptions to catch anf handle the exceptions.
4. Used encapsulation to hide data and used getter and setter for getting and setting the data for the models.
5. Used "ArrayList" to store and manipulate data according to the user preferrences.
6. Used "CSV" Files for handling data.
7. Stored the file path, Scanner class other sensitive information in a separate Utility folder.
8. Used Singleton pattern to avoid creating objects.
9. Used "Date" class for handling date for orders.
10. Handled exceptions for invalid choices.


# Challenges Faced while working on Java-Ecommerce:
 
1.Understanding Project Flow:
     Initially, grasping the overall flow of the project posed a significant challenge.
     It took considerable time to comprehend and navigate through the interconnected modules.
2.Product Data Handling:
     Loading and managing product data from a CSV file presented challenges.
     Debugging errors, especially in exception handling, was initially difficult.
 
3.Category Filtering:
     Implementing category-based filtering for products was a complex task.
     Splitting and processing product categories had unexpected issues, including infinite loops.
 
4.Cart Implementation:
     Working on the cart functionality emerged as the most challenging aspect.
     Debugging, managing cart state, and ensuring proper storage in CSV files required careful attention.
		 And i'm yet to complete Cart implementation.
 
5.Continuous Learning Curve:
     The project exposed me to a continuous learning curve, pushing me to enhance my Java skills.
     Understanding and implementing new features contributed to ongoing learning and development.
 
6.Testing and Debugging:
      Rigorous testing and debugging became crucial in identifying and rectifying subtle issues.
      Ensuring the reliability and stability of the application posed persistent challenges.
 
7.Handling File Operations:
     Efficiently handling file operations, especially reading and writing to CSV files, introduced complexities.
     Addressing issues related to file access and data integrity required carefull handling.
